In this project I'll create a simple calculator including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators.

What I Learned:
-Effectively using booleans to store data of how users interact with UI
-toString(), parseInt(), and parseFloat() are very useful for manipulating numbers within html.
-When parsing arguments between strings and floats, converting a float into a string will remove trailing zeros.
